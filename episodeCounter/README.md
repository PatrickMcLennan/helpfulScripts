These scripts will rename all files of a specified extension within the current directory into a sequenced Episode count.

It can take up to 2 arguments - 1 if you wish to rename all of the files of that extension, 2 if you wish to rename the 2nd extension to the 1st.

Ex.

    node/bash/python3 .episodeCounter.js/sh/py avi
    ^^                                          ^^
    renames all '.avi' files to Episode 1.avi, Episode 2.avi, Episode 3.avi, etc...

    node/bash/python3 .episodeCounter.js/sh/py avi mkv
    ^^                                              ^^
    renames all '.mkv' files to Episode 1.avi, Episode 2.avi, Episode 3.avi, etc...

Useful for when you are re-organizing all of the legally purchased media on your harddrive.
