# checkDirForDoubles

```
const checkDirForDoubles = require('path/to/checkDirForDoubles.js)
```

gives you `checkDirForDoubles(stringArrayOfNames, directory)`, which changes directory into `directory`, gathers an array of existing file names and returns a copy of `stringArrayOfNames` without anything currently existing. Remains in `directory` at the end of the script.
